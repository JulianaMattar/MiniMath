#### About

When I was in 6th grade, my favorite subjects were English, Portuguese, and Math. My then math teacher (Hi, Mr. Forbes!) was in the process of teaching us multiplication and division and, every Friday, he would have us play a game:

1. he would place an A4 piece of paper faced down on each of our desks;
2. each paper had the same number of math problems we had to solve in 2 minutes or less;
3. we could only start the quiz when he had the timer ready and said “Go!”;
4. the student that finished in 2 minutes and had the most correct answers would receive (a) candy and (b) the glory of being the week’s math champion; and
5. we had to wait until Monday to receive the results (plus candy and glory).

As I graduated high school, attended law school, and then became a lawyer, I missed the logical reasoning and mental exercise math promoted. As the years went by without flexing those mental math muscles, doing simple sums and multiplication or division for cooking, calculating the interval between medicine intakes, among a number of other mundane daily tasks, became harder. Which, for someone that really enjoyed math as a child and teenager, is always a bit frustrating.

When I decided to join a web development bootcamp and my first project was to design and create a game from scratch, I thought of doing something both entertaining and educational. Web development has a huge component of logical and mathematical reasoning, which made me realize parts of my brain were getting a huge work-out just by attending classes. It give me the feeling that I am also getting a bit smarter, which, it turns out, may actually be true. 

So If you’d like to build back some of those math neurons (or if you’ve just started to learn!) and have 2 minutes to spare, I invite you to stretch out those math muscles with MiniMath ™. I can’t promise any candy, but once you manage to get all problems correct in under 2 minutes, all the glory and satisfaction (and new brain muscles) will be yours.

Enjoy!
