      When I was in 6th grade, my favorite subjects were English, Portuguese,
      and Math. My then math teacher (Hi, Mr. Forbes!) was in the process of
      teaching us multiplication and division and, every Friday, he would have
      us play a game: 
      <ol>
      <li>He would place an A4 piece of paper faced down on each of
      our desks; </li>
      <li>Each paper had the same number of math problems we had to solve
      in 2 minutes or less;</li> 
      <li>We could only start the quiz when he had the timer
      ready and said “Go!”; </li>
      <li> The student that finished in 2 minutes and had the
      most correct answers would receive (a) candy and (b) the glory of being
      the week’s math champion; and </li>
       <li> We had to wait until Monday to receive the
      results (plus candy and glory).</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      When I graduated high school and went on to law school, and then onto
      being a lawyer, I missed the logical reasoning and mental exercise math
      promoted. As the years went by without flexing those mental math muscles,
      doing simple sums and multiplication or division for cooking, calculating
      the interval between medicine intakes, among a number of other mundane
      daily tasks, became harder. Which, for someone that really enjoyed math as
      a child and teenager, is always a bit frustrating.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I decided to join a web development bootcamp and my first project was
      to design and create a game from scratch, I thought of doing something
      both entertaining and educational. Web development has a huge component of
      logical and mathematical reasoning, which made me realize parts of my
      brain were getting a huge work-out just by attending classes. It give me
      the feeling that I am also getting a bit smarter, which, it turns out, may
      actually be true. <a src="#endnote">*</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      So If you’d like to build back some of those math neurons (or if you’ve
      just started to learn!) and have 2 minutes to spare, I invite you to
      stretch out those math muscles with MiniMath ™. I can’t promise any candy,
      but once you manage to get all problems correct in under 2 minutes, all
      the glory and satisfaction (and new brain muscles) will be yours.
    </p>
    <p>Enjoy!</p>
